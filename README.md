## Hi, I'm Vugar

I'm a **Software & Data Engineer** with a strong interest in **big data systems**, **distributed computing**, and **backend infrastructure**. I like working close to the system level and understanding how things behave at scale.

### 🔍 What I Focus On
- Building **data processing tools** on top of **Apache Spark**
- Exploring **distributed databases** and system internals
- Designing **backend and infrastructure-focused** projects
- Experimenting with **AI / model fine-tuning**

### Selected Work
- **Spark-Flow** — dbt-inspired framework built on Spark  
- **kvaldb (AdCodeLabs)** — distributed key-value database
- **penester** — configuration based experimental security tooling

### 🏢 AdCodeLabs
I maintain **[AdCodeLabs](https://github.com/adcodelabs)** — a GitHub organization where I explore ideas around big data and distributed systems, with the long-term goal of growing it into a collaborative learning space.

### Tech
