## 👋 Hi, I'm Vugar Abdulali

I'm a **Software & Data Engineer** interested in **big data systems, distributed computing, and backend infrastructure**. I enjoy building systems from the ground up and learning how data platforms work at scale.

### 🚀 What I Work On
I explore data processing, system design, and developer tooling through hands-on projects.

#### 💻 Personal Projects
- 🧩 **Spark-Flow** — a Spark-based framework inspired by dbt  
- 🔐 **penester** — experimental security / penetration testing concepts  
- ⚙️ **basic-loadbalancer** — simple load balancing implementation  
- 🤖 **pullow** — C# project exploring agent-based patterns  
- 🧪 **fineTuningProject** — experiments with AI model fine-tuning  
- 💡 **ufaz-hackathon** — hackathon prototype project

#### 🏢 AdCodeLabs
I also maintain **[AdCodeLabs](https://github.com/adcodelabs)** — a GitHub organization where I experiment with ideas around **big data, distributed systems, and backend tooling**.  
Over time, I’d like it to grow into a **small community** where people can learn, collaborate, and build system-level projects together.

Some projects there:
- **kvaldb** — a distributed key-value database  
- **cns** — a CLI NameSpace tool

### 🛠 Tech & Focus Areas
- **Big Data:** Apache Spark, data processing & ETL  
- **Distributed Systems:** scalability, reliability, system internals  
- **Languages:** Python, Go, JavaScript, C#  
- **AI/ML:** experimentation & model fine-tuning

### 📚 Currently Focusing On
- Internals of big data platforms  
- Designing reliable data pipelines  
- Building open, collaborative engineering projects
